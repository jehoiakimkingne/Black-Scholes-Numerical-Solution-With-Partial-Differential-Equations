- This project deals with the Black-Scholes equation used to price a specific type of financial derivatives : European Options. 
- Here, I am trying to build a way to get a numerical solution of this equation using partial differential equations methods.
- A financial derivative is a financial product that derives its value from the value of another financial asset called the underlying asset.
- An European option contract is an agreement between two parties that gives one party the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset at some specified date T in the future for a fixed price K.
- In order to have more understanding on what I have been dealing with in this project, you can have a look on the following documents:

 - This project was done in two main steps:
 
      - I first applied some simple finite difference methods such as Forward Euler or Centered Difference Scheme to a Singular Pertubations Problem and to a Poisson Problem.
      - Then I applied these same methods to solve the Black-Scholes Equation.
